First attempt at using an RNN for text classification; Using a simple spam data set from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/version/1

The results are pretty good (as expected, since spam classification has been shown to be amenable to even Naive Bayes!) The main purpose is to use a similar algorithm/model for financial text analysis
